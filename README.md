# Memory Management Chatbot

The ChatBot code creates a dialogue where users can ask questions about some aspects of memory management in C++.

**How it works**

After the knowledge base of the chatbot has been loaded from a text file, a knowledge graph representation is created in computer memory, where chatbot answers represent the graph nodes and user queries represent the graph edges. After a user query has been sent to the chatbot, the Levenshtein distance is used to identify the most probable answer.

The starter code for this project is fully functional as-is and uses raw pointers to represent the knowledge graph and interconnections between objects throughout the project.

The goal of this project is to optimize the ChatBot program from a memory management perspective (using smart pointers and move semantics). 

## Usage

### Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.11
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* wxWidgets >= 3.0
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev libwxgtk3.0-0v5-dbg`
  * Mac: There is a [homebrew installation available](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/wxmac).
  * Installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Install). Some version numbers may need to be changed in instructions to install v3.0 or greater.

### Make

This project uses [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The Makefile has four targets:
* `build` compiles the source code and generates an executable
* `format` applies [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style the source code
* `debug` compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
* `clean` deletes the `build/` directory, including all of the build artifacts

### Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./membot`.
